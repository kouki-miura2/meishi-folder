# AGENTS.md

## Project Structure

Monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`). Project-specific conventions live in that project's own `AGENTS.md`, not here — read it before working in that folder.

- `apps/backend` — API server (Hono): runtime-agnostic routes and business logic, no entrypoint. See `apps/backend/AGENTS.md`.
- `apps/backend-worker` — Runs `apps/backend` on Cloudflare Workers. See `apps/backend-worker/AGENTS.md`.
- `apps/backend-node` — Runs `apps/backend` as a standalone Node.js server. See `apps/backend-node/AGENTS.md`.
- `apps/frontend` — Web client (Vue 3 + Vuetify 4). See `apps/frontend/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/utils` — Shared runtime utilities (date/time helpers, logger). See `packages/utils/AGENTS.md`.

## Conventions

- Co-location: `foo/bar.ts` + `foo/bar.test.ts`.
- Arrow functions everywhere (`const foo = (...) => {}`), no `function` declarations — one style repo-wide, including `packages/utils`, so there's no per-case judgment call.
- Favor less code: reach for a framework's built-in feature over a hand-rolled one, avoid speculative abstractions and shared packages "just in case", and don't introduce a layer until it earns its keep.
- API request/response types are not hand-shared: `apps/frontend` gets them from `apps/backend` via Hono RPC, not from a separate types package.
- Runtime-agnostic shared code goes in `packages/utils`, not duplicated per app.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
